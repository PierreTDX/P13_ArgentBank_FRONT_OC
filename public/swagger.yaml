      summary: Fetch and filter account transactions with pagination and sorting options API
      description: |
        API for fetching account transactions, with a default return of **30 most recent transactions**, sorted by various elements.

        - **The API retrieves the most recent transaction** of an account (with `accountId` allowed by JWT).
        - Transactions are **sorted from newest to oldest** by default, but clients can specify different sorting criteria if needed.
        - Clients can **paginate results** using query:
          - `limit`: Number of transactions per page (default: **30**).
          - `page`: Page number (starts from **1**, default: **1**).
        - Clients can **filter transactions** using:
          - `startDate` and `endDate` to define a date range.
          - `description` to search for a specific keyword in transaction descriptions.
          - `minAmount` and `maxAmount` to filter by transaction amounts.
          - `transactionType` and `category` to refine results by type or category.
          - `notes` to filter transactions:
            - `true`: Only transactions with user notes.
            - `false`: Only transactions without user notes.
            - `all` (default): No filtering on notes.
          - Sorting options allow flexibility in viewing transactions based on different attributes (e.g., amount, category).

        `For the front-end`: To fetch all transactions from the current month => define a date range:
          - `startDate` = the current day
          - `endDate` = the current day minus 31 days

      summary: Update Notes for a Transaction API
      description: |
        API to update the notes and category of a transaction.

        - This API allows the user to update specific details of a transaction. The transaction is identified by its `id` in the query, while the `accountId` is validated using the JWT token. 
        - The user making the update is identified through the `userIdOfNote` field, which is extracted from the JWT token. Only the user associated with the transaction can update the transaction details.
        - The fields `category` and `notes` can be updated independently.
        - `category` must be one of the predefined allowed values. This field is optional but must be validated if provided.
        - This API is intended to allow partial updates to transaction, so not all fields are required in the request body.

        The transaction ID belongs to the authenticated user to successfully perform the update.
